# Community vendor tree

This is a vendor tree that allows developers to compile Android 2.0 (eclair)
for some devices.  It is based off work by [cyanogen][1], [lox][2], kiall and
jnwhiteh and can be used as a base for custom ROMS.

Currently supported devices are

- HTC Hero
- Acer Liquid (in progress)

[Please read the wiki for further instructions][3]
